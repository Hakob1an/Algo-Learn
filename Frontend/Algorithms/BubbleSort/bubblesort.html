        <h1>Bubble Sort</h1>
    <p>
        Bubble sort is a fundamental sorting algorithm in computer science, distinguished by its simple method of 
        repeatedly traversing through the list and comparing pairs of adjacent elements. Whenever two consecutive 
        elements are found to be out of order—for instance, if the left element is greater than the right element 
        in an ascending sort—the algorithm swaps them. As it iterates from the beginning of the list to the end, 
        larger elements gradually “bubble” toward the rightmost positions with each pass, while smaller elements 
        remain near the left side. This process continues until the list is sorted, which is signaled by a complete 
        traversal that encounters no required swaps.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        In mathematical terms, bubble sort exhibits a time complexity of <code>O(n²)</code> for both worst-case and 
        average-case scenarios, where <code>n</code> represents the number of elements in the list. The quadratic 
        nature of this complexity means that bubble sort may become prohibitively slow when dealing with large 
        collections of data, thereby rendering it less practical than more efficient algorithms such as merge sort, 
        quicksort, or heapsort in most real-world settings.
    </p>

    <h2>Educational Value</h2>
    <p>
        Despite its inefficiency in handling large inputs, bubble sort remains an instructive example of core 
        algorithmic principles. The conceptual simplicity of its step-by-step comparison process makes it an ideal 
        tool for teaching foundational topics such as algorithmic thinking, loop construction, and the notion of 
        incremental progress in sorting.
    </p>

    <h2>Optimization</h2>
    <p>
        An optimized version of bubble sort incorporates a flag to detect whether any swaps have been performed 
        during a given pass. If a complete pass results in no swaps, the array must already be sorted, and the 
        algorithm can terminate early. While this optimization helps with nearly sorted inputs, bubble sort’s 
        performance remains hindered by its excessive comparisons and swaps.
    </p>

    <h2>Example of Bubble Sort in Action</h2>
    <p>Suppose we have an unsorted list of integers:</p>
    <pre>[5, 3, 8, 4, 2]</pre>

    <h3>First Pass:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Compare (5, 3) → swap → <code>[3, 5, 8, 4, 2]</code></li>
        <li>Compare (5, 8) → no swap</li>
        <li>Compare (8, 4) → swap → <code>[3, 5, 4, 8, 2]</code></li>
        <li>Compare (8, 2) → swap → <code>[3, 5, 4, 2, 8]</code></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Second Pass:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Compare (3, 5) → no swap</li>
        <li>Compare (5, 4) → swap → <code>[3, 4, 5, 2, 8]</code></li>
        <li>Compare (5, 2) → swap → <code>[3, 4, 2, 5, 8]</code></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Third Pass:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Compare (3, 4) → no swap</li>
        <li>Compare (4, 2) → swap → <code>[3, 2, 4, 5, 8]</code></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Fourth Pass:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Compare (3, 2) → swap → <code>[2, 3, 4, 5, 8]</code></li>
    </ul>
    <p>At this point, the list is sorted.</p>

    <h2>Time and Space Complexity</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Worst-case:</strong> <code>O(n²)</code> (Reverse order list)</li>
        <li><strong>Average-case:</strong> <code>O(n²)</code></li>
        <li><strong>Best-case:</strong> <code>O(n)</code> (Already sorted list)</li>
        <li><strong>Space Complexity:</strong> <code>O(1)</code> (In-place sorting algorithm)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Pros and Cons</h2>

    <h3>Advantages</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Simplicity:</strong> Easy to understand and implement.</li>
        <li><strong>In-Place Sorting:</strong> Does not require extra memory.</li>
        <li><strong>Stable:</strong> Maintains relative order of equal elements.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Disadvantages</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Poor Performance:</strong> Quadratic time complexity makes it inefficient for large lists.</li>
        <li><strong>Excessive Comparisons and Swaps:</strong> Leads to unnecessary computations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        While bubble sort is rarely used in practical applications due to its inefficiency, it remains an excellent 
        educational tool for understanding sorting algorithms. Its simplicity and stability make it a useful algorithm 
        for small datasets and teaching purposes, but for larger datasets, more efficient sorting algorithms like 
        quicksort, mergesort, or heapsort are preferred.
